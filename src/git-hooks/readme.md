## Install Windows Git hooks

Pre-requisite : you must have installed powershell core 6+
and a `pwsh` command must be available

Execute `./initial-setup.ps1`. It will copy windows git-hooks into .git/hooks

I recommand you set default terminal to `pwsh` in intellij and set
the environment variable `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`


## Install Linux Git hooks
